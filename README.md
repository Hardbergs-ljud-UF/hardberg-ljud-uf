Our website, yes it was a spelling mistake, no I won't fix it

## Work in Progress

## Contributing
We use Jekyll with the `github-pages` gem to generate the site, so make sure you have a correct environment set up

### To contribute to the main site code
1. Fork the `#prod` branch, preferably with a descriptive new branch name
2. Make any changes you think are necessary
3. Create a merge request into `#prod` with a descriptive title and description
4. If we think it is a good change, the request will be approved

### To contribute to the README.md
1. Fork the `#main` branch and give it a clear name
2. make the changes
3. Create a merge request into `#main`
4. If we think the changes are good, we will approve it

#### In both cases you could also commit to a new branch instead of making it from the start, if you prefer, but you won't be able to commit directly
